XiamenBus Dataset For Passenger Counting

This dataset is specialized for passenger counting in bus carriages. This dataset contains images of passengers in bus carriages captured by cameras installed in normal public service buses and route-specific Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) buses, which are managed by the public transportation cooperation of the Xiamen city. The images are provided by the LanSi Co. Ltd, who manufactured and installed terminal devices in the buses with attached cameras. 

This dataset contains 1549 images with size $288{\times}352$. The images in this dataset contain a number of passengers ranging from 0 to 36, usually fewer than the images in the above three datasets. Among the images, we use 1327 for training and 222 for testing.
